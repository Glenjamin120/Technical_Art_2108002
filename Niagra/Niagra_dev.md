# notes

Niagra system a top levevel container that holds emiters
simulate effects
emmiters control particles 
Better start with base emmiter e.g rain or explosion
particle materials 
have collisions vry easy in unreal not unity


Global Illumination calc how light bounces, direct and indirect, good for changing lights
ambient occl soft shadows
hard/soft raytrace- lumen = software hardware can be used 
virt shadow map to add performace to shadows, more stable
reflection syst lumen refle, raytrace - realistic, screen space refl - limited to screen but dynamic
reflection capt, uses probes static reflection, not dynamic
planar refl, dynamix reflection for flat surfaces e.g miror
